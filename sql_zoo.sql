-- UEFA EURO 2012
-- The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime

-- Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
 SELECT matchid, player FROM goal
   WHERE teamid = 'GER'

  --  From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

  --  Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

  --  Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012

 SELECT DISTINCT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game JOIN goal
    ON game.id = goal.matchid
  WHERE goal.matchid = 1012

  --  3.
  --  You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.

   SELECT *
     FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
  --  The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The ON says how to figure out which rows in game go with which rows in goal - the id from goal must match matchid from game. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
  --  ON (game.id=goal.matchid)

  --  The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.

  --  Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate and for every German goal.

  SELECT player,teamid, stadium, mdate
    FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    WHERE teamid = 'GER'

  --  4.
  --  Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.

  --  Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'

  SELECT team1, team2, player
    FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'

  --  5.
  --  The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id

  --  Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10


   SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
     FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id)
    WHERE gtime <= 10

  --  6.
  --  To JOIN game with eteam you could use either
  --  game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)

  --  Notice that because id is a column name in both game and eteam you must specify eteam.id instead of just id

  --  List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

  SELECT mdate, teamname
    FROM game JOIN eteam ON (game.team1=eteam.id)
   WHERE coach = 'Fernando Santos'

  --  7.
  --  List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

  SELECT player

    GROUP BY matchid


  --  13.
  --  List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

  --  10 June 2012	ESP	1	ITA	1
  --  10 June 2012	IRL	1	CRO	3
  --  ...
  --  Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your  by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.


   SELECT mdate,
     team1,
     SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1
     ELSE 0 END) AS score1,
